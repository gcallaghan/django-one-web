Django One Web
==============

What is Django One Web?
------------------------

Django One web is an attempt to provide a tempalting platform for django
projects using future proof best practices and mobile first design. 

Based on:

* Paul Irish's html5 boilerplate : http://html5boilerplate.com
* Andy Clark's 320 and up : http://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/projects/320andup/

Installation
------------

I'm working on that. It will go something like:

* Download
* Placing somewhere on your python path 
* Add to your INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py

Requirements
------------

* I like sass and compass so you'll need that.
* I've included modified versions of 320 and html5 boilerplate
* Django of course

Usage
-----

The goal is to provide a base template for your templates to inherit from.
This template will include some best practice blocks to utilize for individual
project creation.
